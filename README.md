# AI-builder-snake-verification

this model was created by:
  Yoth Srimanchanda
  Pannawat Kerdpin
as our project for our class: ET32201

all the resources for the model ie. images used to train, test, and valid are all compiled by me and my friend. Which means it's not perfect.
even though it's not perfect it's still the only option for our model since we can't find any other Thailand snakes dataset
